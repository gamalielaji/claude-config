name: code-review
description: "Performs an architectural and quality code review on a specified file or set of files. Checks for coding standard compliance, architectural pattern adherence, SOLID principles, testability, and performance concerns."

### When NOT to use this skill
- For generated/auto-created files (protobuf output, build artifacts, lock files)
- For prototype code in `prototypes/` directories (intentionally relaxed standards)
- For third-party or vendored code the team does not own
- For config-only files (JSON, YAML) with no logic — use asset-audit instead

### Example invocations
- `/code-review src/combat/DamageSystem.cs` — review a single file
- `/code-review src/networking/` — review all files in a directory

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the target file(s)** in full.

2. **Read the CLAUDE.md** for project coding standards.

3. **Identify the system category** (engine, gameplay, AI, networking, UI, tools)
   and apply category-specific standards.

4. **Evaluate against coding standards**:
   - [ ] Public methods and classes have doc comments
   - [ ] Cyclomatic complexity under 10 per method
   - [ ] No method exceeds 40 lines (excluding data declarations)
   - [ ] Dependencies are injected (no static singletons for game state)
   - [ ] Configuration values loaded from data files
   - [ ] Systems expose interfaces (not concrete class dependencies)

5. **Check architectural compliance**:
   - [ ] Correct dependency direction (engine <- gameplay, not reverse)
   - [ ] No circular dependencies between modules
   - [ ] Proper layer separation (UI does not own game state)
   - [ ] Events/signals used for cross-system communication
   - [ ] Consistent with established patterns in the codebase

6. **Check SOLID compliance**:
   - [ ] Single Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
   - [ ] Open/Closed: Extendable without modification
   - [ ] Liskov Substitution: Subtypes substitutable for base types
   - [ ] Interface Segregation: No fat interfaces
   - [ ] Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

7. **Check for common game development issues**:
   - [ ] Frame-rate independence (delta time usage)
   - [ ] No allocations in hot paths (update loops)
   - [ ] Proper null/empty state handling
   - [ ] Thread safety where required
   - [ ] Resource cleanup (no leaks)

8. **Output the review** in this format:
