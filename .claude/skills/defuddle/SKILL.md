description: Extract clean markdown content from web pages using Defuddle CLI, removing clutter and navigation to save tokens. Use instead of WebFetch when the user provides a URL to read or analyze, for online documentation, articles, blog posts, or any standard web page.

## Context Engineering (Karpathy Method)

Before execution, this skill automatically:

1. **Load** — Read all files referenced by the user or implied by the task
2. **Research** — If the task involves unfamiliar patterns or decisions, use WebSearch for current best practices (2-3 targeted queries, time-boxed to <20% of task)
3. **Scope** — Define exactly what this skill will produce and what it will NOT touch
4. **Constraints** — Identify boundaries before starting (format, quality bar, domain limits)

After execution, verify:
- [ ] Primary deliverable produced and matches requested format
- [ ] All user requirements addressed, no unresolved assumptions
- [ ] No scope creep beyond the task
- [ ] Recommendations are evidence-based (code, docs, or research)


# Defuddle

Use Defuddle CLI to extract clean readable content from web pages. Prefer over WebFetch for standard web pages — it removes navigation, ads, and clutter, reducing token usage.

If not installed: `npm install -g defuddle`

## Usage

Always use `--md` for markdown output:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> --md
```

Save to file:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> --md -o content.md
```

Extract specific metadata:

```bash
defuddle parse <url> -p title
defuddle parse <url> -p description
defuddle parse <url> -p domain
```

## Output formats

| Flag | Format |
|------|--------|
| `--md` | Markdown (default choice) |
| `--json` | JSON with both HTML and markdown |
| (none) | HTML |
| `-p <name>` | Specific metadata property |

## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Before presenting final output:

1. Re-read output against the original request
2. Verify all success criteria are met
3. Check that output matches expected format/template
4. Ensure no scope creep or unrequested additions
5. Confirm recommendations are backed by evidence
