## Context Engineering (Karpathy Method)

Before execution, this skill automatically:

1. **Load** — Read all files referenced by the user or implied by the task
2. **Research** — If the task involves unfamiliar patterns or decisions, use WebSearch for current best practices (2-3 targeted queries, time-boxed to <20% of task)
3. **Scope** — Define exactly what this skill will produce and what it will NOT touch
4. **Constraints** — Identify boundaries before starting (format, quality bar, domain limits)

After execution, verify:
- [ ] Primary deliverable produced and matches requested format
- [ ] All user requirements addressed, no unresolved assumptions
- [ ] No scope creep beyond the task
- [ ] Recommendations are evidence-based (code, docs, or research)


When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the CLAUDE.md** for project overview and standards.

2. **Read the relevant agent definition** from `.claude/agents/` if a specific
   role is specified.

3. **Scan the codebase** for the relevant area:
   - For programmers: scan `src/` for architecture, patterns, key files
   - For designers: scan `design/` for existing design documents
   - For narrative: scan `design/narrative/` for world-building and story docs
   - For QA: scan `tests/` for existing test coverage
   - For production: scan `production/` for current sprint and milestone

4. **Read recent changes** (git log if available) to understand current momentum.

5. **Generate the onboarding document**:

```markdown
