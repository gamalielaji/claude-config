## Context Engineering (Karpathy Method)

Before execution, this skill automatically:

1. **Load** — Read all files referenced by the user or implied by the task
2. **Research** — If the task involves unfamiliar patterns or decisions, use WebSearch for current best practices (2-3 targeted queries, time-boxed to <20% of task)
3. **Scope** — Define exactly what this skill will produce and what it will NOT touch
4. **Constraints** — Identify boundaries before starting (format, quality bar, domain limits)

After execution, verify:
- [ ] Primary deliverable produced and matches requested format
- [ ] All user requirements addressed, no unresolved assumptions
- [ ] No scope creep beyond the task
- [ ] Recommendations are evidence-based (code, docs, or research)


When invoked with `new`, generate this template:
